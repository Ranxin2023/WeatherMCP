# Code Explanation for `weather.py`
## 1. Imports and Constants
```python
from typing import Any
import httpx
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
```
- `typing.Any` → allows type hints for variables that can hold any type of value.
- `httpx` → an async HTTP client library (like requests, but supports async/await).
- `FastMCP` → part of the MCP framework; it makes defining and serving AI “tools” easy.
```python
mcp = FastMCP("weather")
```
- Initializes an **MCP server** instance named `"weather"`.
- This lets you expose “tools” (functions) that can be called through the MCP protocol.
```python
NWS_API_BASE = "https://api.weather.gov"
USER_AGENT = "weather-app/1.0"
```
- Base URL for the **National Weather Service (NWS)** API.
- Custom user agent — required because NWS blocks requests without one.

## 2. `make_nws_request(url: str)`
```python
async def make_nws_request(url: str) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
    """Make a request to the NWS API with proper error handling."""
```
### Purpose: 
- Handles all HTTP requests to the NWS API, including error handling and JSON parsing.
### How it works:
1. Defines request headers (user agent + accept type).
2. Uses an asynchronous HTTP client (`httpx.AsyncClient`) to make a GET request.
3. If successful, returns `response.json()` (a dictionary).
4. If any exception occurs (e.g., timeout, network error, invalid response), returns `None`.

## 3. `format_alert(feature: dict)`
```python
def format_alert(feature: dict) -> str:
    """Format an alert feature into a readable string."""
```

- **Purpose:**
    - Handles all HTTP requests to the NWS API, including error handling and JSON parsing.
- **How it works:**
    - Defines request headers (user agent + accept type).
    - Uses an asynchronous HTTP client (`httpx.AsyncClient`) to make a GET request.
